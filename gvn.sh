  echo "gvn is a simple wrapper around svn to seem more git-like. Not everything will be implemented. But here's a quick primer:"
  echo " "
  echo "This is coming from someone who is just barely learning svn. But from my understanding: svn is a centralized version control system, while git is decentralized. Git is more easily imagined as a tree, while svn is represents more of a file structure. Most operations on git and svn are the same, but some key gotchas:"
  echo " "
  echo "1. svn commiting goes straight to the server. There are no local commits in svn compared to git."
  echo " "
  echo "2. svn workflow can vary greatly from github. In git it is usually encouraged to branch everything, as merging is not a headache once you understand it. Master is supposed to be an always working build, and feature branches are reviewed before being pulled in. However, rumor is, merging is kind of a pain in svn, because its master branch, called trunk, is a centralized source of truth, and will often times not like what you are brining in. So svn workflows can follow the standard git style. Or follow a wild wild west trunk that everyone just commits to, and makes branches when there is a well tested point in time, or revision, for release."
